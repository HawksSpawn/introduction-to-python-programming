**Introduction to Python Programming**

In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of the Python programming language, along with programming best practices. You’ll learn to represent and store data using Python
data types and variables, and use conditionals and loops to control the flow of your programs. You’ll harness the power of complex data structures like lists, sets,
dictionaries, and tuples to store collections of related data. You’ll define and document your own custom functions, write scripts, and handle errors. Lastly, you’ll learn to
find and use modules in the Python Standard Library and other third-party libraries.

### Control Flow

* Write conditional expressions using if statements and boolean expressions to add decision making to your Python programs
* Use for and while loops along with useful built-in functions to iterate over and manipulate lists, sets, and dictionaries
* Condense for loops to create lists efficiently with list comprehensions
