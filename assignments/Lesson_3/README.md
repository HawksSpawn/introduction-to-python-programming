## Quiz: Verse Dictionary

In the code, you'll find a dictionary containing the unique words of `verse` stored as keys<br>and the number of times they appear in `verse` stored as values. 
Use this dictionary to answer<br>the following questions.

Answer these using code, rather than inspecting the dictionary manually!

1. How many unique words are in _verse_dict_?
2. Is the key "breathe" in _verse_dict_?
3. What is the first element in the list created when _verse_dict_ is sorted by keys?  
   **Hint:** Use the appropriate dictionary method to get a list of its keys, and then sort that list. Use<br>this list of keys to answer the next two questions as well.
4. Which key (word) has the highest value in _verse_dict_?
