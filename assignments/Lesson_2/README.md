## Quiz: Which is denser, Rio or San Francisco?

Try comparison operators in this quiz! This code calculates the population densities of Rio de Janeiro and San Francisco.

Write code to compare these densities. Is the population of San Francisco more dense than that of Rio de Janeiro? Print `True` if it is and `False` if not.

## Quiz: Write a Server Log Message

In this programming quiz, you’re going to use what you’ve learned about strings to write a logging message for a server.

You’ll be provided with example data for a user, the time of their visit and the site they accessed. You should use the variables provided and the techniques you’ve learned to print a log message like this one (with the username, url, and timestamp replaced with values from the appropriate variables):

`Yogesh accessed the site http://petshop.com/pets/reptiles/pythons at 16:20.`

## Quiz: `len()`

Use string concatenation and the `len()` function to find the length of a certain movie star's actual full name. Store that length in the `name_length` variable. Don't forget that there are spaces in between the different parts of a name!

## Quiz: String Methods Coding Practice

Below, we have a string variable that contains the first verse of the poem, [If by Rudyard Kipling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If%E2%80%94). Remember, `\n` is a special sequence of characters that causes a line break (a new line).

```
verse = "If you can keep your head when all about you\n  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,\nIf you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\n  But make allowance for their doubting too;\nIf you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\n  Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,\nOr being hated, don’t give way to hating,\n  And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:"

```

Use the code editor below to answer the following questions about `verse` and use Test Run to check your output in the quiz at the bottom of this page.

1. What is the length of the string variable `verse`?
2. What is the index of the first occurrence of the word 'and' in `verse`?
3. What is the index of the last occurrence of the word 'you' in `verse`?
4. What is the count of occurrences of the word 'you' in the `verse`?
